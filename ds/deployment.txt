Stage 1: The Foundations (Atoms)


 This is the "DNA" stage. You build these pieces in isolation so they are perfect before they ever touch a real page.

[x] Colors: Monochrome palette (Grays/Blacks) + Electric Blue.

[x] Typography: The Prompt font scale (H1, H2, Body, Small Caption).

[x] Buttons: The "Filled" primary and "Outline" secondary styles.

[x] inputs: Clean, minimalist text boxes with thin 
borders.

[x] List Item Base: The "row" container—setting the height, padding, and the subtle divider line.

[x] Icons: Simple, "Linear" icons (Wrenches, Trucks, Documents) that feel engineered.

Stage 2:

 The Interactions (Molecules)
This is where we combine the atoms to create functional pieces for the construction field.

[] Search Bar: A text input with a magnifying glass icon.

[] Field Labeling: A Prompt label paired with an input (e.g., "Site Address").

[] Status Badges: Small, colored pills (e.g., "In Progress" or "Completed").

[] File Uploader: A simple box to drag and drop job-site photos.

Stage 3: 

The Workflows (Organisms)
These are the heavy-duty sections that handle your complex on-field data.

[] The Data Table: Your most important piece—clean rows of text with a high-contrast "View" button.

[] The Navigation Bar: A sleek, dark side-menu or top-header (Audi-style).

[] The Inspection Card: A container holding a title, a description, and a "Sign Off" button.

[] The Modal: An "overlay" window that pops up when a user needs to confirm an action.

Stage 4: 

The Interface (Templates & Pages)
This is the final assembly where you connect the system to your data.

[] Project Dashboard: An overview of all active job sites.

[] Daily Log Page: The screen where the foreman enters their daily progress.

[] Settings/Profile: A clean space to manage user details.
